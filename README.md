_git clone <https://github.com/eypsrcnuygr/Tic-Tac-Toe.git>_

**Step 2**: Direct a terminal into the cloned repository directory

_cd Tic-Tac-Toe_

**Step 4**: type `main.rb` into the command line, open it in irb, or edit it in a text editor. If you chose to ignore step 3, type `ruby bin/main.rb`

## How to play

**Step 1**: After starting the program you will be prompted to choose either a human opponent or the cpu.

**Step 2**: Once an opponent is chosen, X's will go first (this will be you).

**Step 3**: The board is arranged in a grid from 1-9. The first row is 1-3, the second row is 4-6, and the third row is 7-9. Choose a position accordingly. After which, your opponent will do the same.

**Step 4**: Continue this process until either one player has 3 in a row or there are no squares left.

**Step 5**: The game will either declare a winner or end in a Cat's Game.
